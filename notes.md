Use opencv from within a docker container.

# OpenCV Docker
Might want to make a separate repo to maintain the build file for an opencv docker container. That way the separate repo could build and deploy to dockerhub or something.

WARNING! OpenCV 4 installation **requires** Python 3.6 (NOT Python 3.7+)

see installation instructions: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/17/install-opencv-4-on-macos/

see example dockerfile: https://github.com/vishwesh5/OpenCV-Docker/blob/master/Dockerfile
